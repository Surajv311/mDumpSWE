# Multithreading-Asynchronous-Synchronous


```
An analogy usually helps. You are cooking in a restaurant. An order comes in for eggs and toast.
Synchronous: you cook the eggs, then you cook the toast.
Asynchronous, single threaded: you start the eggs cooking and set a timer. You start the toast cooking, and set a timer. While they are both cooking, you clean the kitchen. When the timers go off you take the eggs off the heat and the toast out of the toaster and serve them.
Asynchronous, multithreaded: you hire two more cooks, one to cook eggs and one to cook toast. Now you have the problem of coordinating the cooks so that they do not conflict with each other in the kitchen when sharing resources. And you have to pay them.
```

When you execute something synchronously, you wait for it to finish before moving on to another task. When you execute something asynchronously, you can move on to another task before it finishes.

**Threading** is about workers; **asynchrony** is about tasks.

Asynchronous programming might be more powerful and efficient when coupled with multiple threads or processes, it can still provide advantages in certain scenarios:
- I/O-Bound Operations: In a single-threaded, multi-core environment, asynchronous programming is particularly effective for I/O-bound tasks, such as network requests, file I/O, and database queries. When one task is waiting for I/O, the CPU can switch to executing other tasks. This allows the program to use the available cores more efficiently and keep the CPU busy even when some tasks are blocked.
- Concurrency and Responsiveness: Asynchronous programming allows the application to remain responsive even when dealing with I/O-bound tasks. In a multi-core system, the event loop can manage multiple tasks concurrently, ensuring that one blocked task doesn't prevent others from making progress.
- Scalability: Even though you have a single thread, the application can scale to utilize multiple cores effectively. If you have a pool of tasks, the event loop can distribute these tasks across multiple cores, enabling better resource utilization.
- Simplified Concurrency Handling: Asynchronous programming still provides a simpler approach to managing concurrency compared to traditional multi-threading or multiprocessing. It eliminates the need to manage low-level synchronization primitives, reducing the risk of race conditions and other synchronization issues.
- Resource Utilization: Asynchronous programming can help maximize resource utilization, such as network connections and memory. While one task is waiting for I/O, other tasks can execute, making better use of available resources.

Consider below scenarios: 
- Single Thread, Single Core:
  - In this scenario, both synchronous and asynchronous code won't have significant benefits in terms of parallelism. Asynchronous code could still provide benefits in terms of responsiveness, managing I/O-bound tasks efficiently, and simplifying concurrency handling.
- Single Thread, Multiple Cores:
  - While a single thread can't fully utilize multiple cores for CPU-bound tasks due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, asynchronous code can help make better use of the CPU time by interleaving tasks during I/O operations. Asynchronous programming can still offer benefits in responsiveness, managing I/O-bound tasks, and concurrency handling.
- Multiple Threads, Multiple Cores:
  - Using multiple threads in a multi-core environment can allow you to better utilize CPU resources. Asynchronous code, combined with multiple threads, can help manage I/O-bound tasks efficiently and provide better parallelism for tasks running in different threads. However, the GIL can still limit the true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks in CPython.
- Multiple Processes, Multiple Cores:
  - Using multiple processes in a multi-core environment enables parallelism without the GIL limitations. Asynchronous code can still help manage I/O-bound tasks efficiently within each process. Additionally, asynchronous code within each process can provide responsiveness and handle concurrency more easily.

In all these above scenarios, asynchronous code can provide benefits in terms of managing I/O-bound tasks, responsiveness, and simplifying concurrency handling. However, when it comes to fully utilizing multiple cores for CPU-bound tasks, asynchronous code in combination with multiple threads or processes is more effective.
