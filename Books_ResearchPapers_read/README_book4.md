## Inside the Java Virtual Machine (Bill Venners)

#### Interesting points/notes:

- Chapter 1: Introduction to Javaís Architecture
  - At the heart of Java technology lies the Java Virtual Machine--the abstract computer on which all Java programs run.
  - One challenge presented to developers by a networked computing environment is the wide range of devices that networks interconnect. A typical network usually has many different kinds of attached devices, with diverse hardware architectures, operating systems, and purposes. Java addresses this challenge by: 
    - Enabling the creation of platform-independent programs. A single Java program can run unchanged on a wide range of computers and devices. Compared with programs compiled for a specific hardware and operating system, platform-independent programs written in Java can be easier and cheaper to develop, administer, and maintain.
    - Another challenge the network presents to software developers is security - Java covers it. 
    - One opportunity created by an omnipresent network is online software distribution. Java takes advantage of this opportunity by enabling the transmission of binary code in small pieces across networks. 
  - ***Javaís architecture*** arises out of four distinct but interrelated technologies, each of which is defined by a separate specification from Sun Microsystems:
    - the Java programming language
    - the Java class file format
    - the Java Application Programming Interface 
    - the Java Virtual Machine
  -
