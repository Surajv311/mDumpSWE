- An **API** is a messenger that delivers your request to the provider you're requesting it from and then responds to you. ​​APIs are request-based, meaning that they operate when requests come from 3rd party apps.
- **Webhook**, also called reverse API, web callback, or an HTTP push API, is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. It delivers data as an event happens or almost immediately. Webhooks are event-based, meaning they will run when a specific event occurs in the source app. ​​To use a real-world analogy, APIs would be likened to you repeatedly calling a retailer to ask if they've stocked up on a brand of shoes you like. Webhooks would then ask the retailer to contact you whenever they have the shoes in stock, which frees up time on both sides. 
- **Websockets** are different, it is an open connection. With WebSockets, a persistent connection (means, continuous polling) is established between the client and server, enabling real-time data transfer in both directions. This is particularly useful for applications that require continuous, low-latency communication, such as online games or chat applications.
