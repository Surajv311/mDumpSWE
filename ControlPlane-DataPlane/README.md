# ControlPlane & DataPlane

- In networking, a plane is an abstract conception of where certain processes take place. The term is used in the sense of "plane of existence." The two most commonly referenced planes in networking are the control plane and the data plane (also known as the forwarding plane).
- The control plane is the part of a network that controls how data packets are forwarded â€” meaning how data is sent from one place to another. The process of creating a routing table, for example, is considered part of the control plane. Routers use various protocols to identify network paths, and they store these paths in routing tables.
- In contrast to the control plane, which determines how packets should be forwarded, the data plane actually forwards the packets. The data plane is also called the forwarding plane.
- Think of the control plane as being like the stoplights that operate at the intersections of a city. Meanwhile, the data plane (or the forwarding plane) is more like the cars that drive on the roads, stop at the intersections, and obey the stoplights.
